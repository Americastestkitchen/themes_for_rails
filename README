h1. Theme Support for Rails 3

h2. Features list / Wish list

* Support for adding themes which includes stylesheets, javascripts, views and layouts. 

<pre>
APP/
  themes/
    default/
      javascripts
      layouts
      stylesheets
      views  
</pre>


h2. Ideas

* Add ThemeSupport::Railtie for configuration, so we selectively set the plugin on or off. Also to be able to change several settings. 
* Add routes to allow access to the theme's static resources (js and cs), unless cached on public folder by capistrano / rake. 
* Extend Action View path in order to make the views accessible. Same for the layouts.
