h1. Theme Support for Rails 3

h2. Features list / Wish list

* Support for adding themes which includes stylesheets, javascripts, views and layouts. 

<pre>
APP/
  themes/
    default/
      javascripts
      layouts
      stylesheets
      views  
</pre>


h2. Ideas

* Add ThemeSupport::Railtie for configuration, so we selectively set the plugin on or off. Also to be able to change several settings. 
* Add routes to allow access to the theme's static resources (js and cs), unless cached on public folder by capistrano / rake. 
* Extend Action View path in order to make the views accessible. Same for the layouts. 

h2. Things to remember.

* Final version should be a gem. Initialization hooks doesn't work when using this as a plugin (vendor/plugins).
* Research about testing this kind of gem. I really don't have a clue.
* I should probably load the theme list at start time, to be able to consult it as needed. I am gonna need that when dealing with runtime  theme selection. Many themes are going to be used simultaneously, so I have to be able to swith view paths as fast as I can. 


h2. Running tests

<pre>
gem install bundler
bundle install
rspec spec
